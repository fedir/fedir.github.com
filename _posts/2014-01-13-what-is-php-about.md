## Intro

Recently I've found the list of Rasmus Lerdorf's quotes, which is absolutely confirmed my feeling about PHP.

## Rasmus Lerdorf

It's a guy, who made PHP. We could say, the initial idea of PHP comes from him. And even, if PHP seriously evolved over last years, we still could say, what the idea of PHP is still here. 

## Rasmus's quotes

### I've never thought of PHP as more than a simple tool to solve problems. 

PHP is a small, pragmatic language to solve complex problems.

### PHP is about as exciting as your toothbrush. You use it every day, it does the job, it is a simple tool, so what? Who would want to read about toothbrushes?

It's better to accept PHP like this without to make a competititon with other languages about code beauty, efficiency.

### Ugly problems often require ugly solutions. Solving an ugly problem in a pure manner is bloody hard.  

Any PHP project, which will not respect this logic, will be not efficient, it will not survive and should not be used in long term usage.

## How to use PHP in the best way ?

Try to make as smart and simple applications as You can. Do not looks always on other languages. Just understand, what You need to solve and solve it in the most simple way You could.
