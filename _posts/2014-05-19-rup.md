RUP is a software development process, which divides the development process into four distinct phases that each involve business modeling, analysis and design, implementation, testing, and deployment.

The four phases are:

 

1. Inception - The idea for the project is stated. Checking, if the project worth it, which ressources we need.

2. Elaboration - further project's evaluation. Defining possible project's application and costs.

3. Construction - project is designed, developed and tested before to send it to final client.

4. Transition - release to the public. Final adjustments are made based on feedback from end users.
